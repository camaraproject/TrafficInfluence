  title: Traffic Influence
  description: |
    # Overview
    The reference scenario foresees a Service, composed by one or more Service
    Producers deployed in different geographical locations in a distributed
    Telco Edge Cloud. The Service Producer, deployed at the Edge, is referred
    as Edge Application Server.

    The life cycle management of the Edge Application Server can be done with APIs, for example the CAMARA
    "Edge Application Management API" under definition in the CAMARA Edge
    Cloud repository (https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud).
    The Telco Edge Cloud is composed by Edge Cloud Regions that contain
    Edge Cloud Zones. For a more complete definition of such Telco Edge Cloud
    architecture, please refer to the "Edge Application Management API"
    documentation. A developer can deploy and run applications on an Edge
    Cloud Zone, meaning reduced latency to end users that are nearby, as the
    network path is shorter. A network operator's EdgeCloud may comprise
    multiple Edge Cloud Zones, each in a discrete location to bring latency
    benefits to end users across a country.

    The operator can help developers knowing which of the Edge Cloud Zones will
    bring the optimal performance for a given end user and application.

    The Traffic Influence API provides the optimal routing from the
    user Device (e.g. a Smartphone) to the optimal Edge Application Server instance in a specific
    geographical location, installed in an Edge Cloud Zone.

    If a Service is offered by Cloud Instances and by Edge Instances, the Traffic Influence
    API can be used get the optimal routing of the traffic to the Edge
    Instances, maybe for a set of users. Getting the optimal routing can be
    used to improve latency maybe in combination with other CAMARA APIs such as
    QoD (Quality On Demand). Providing the optimal routing is indeed an
    important step to get the optimal latency.

    If the Traffic Influence API is used to get the best routing at the Edge for a Device in a
    geographical location and the Device moves to another geographical location,
    the Traffic Influence API can be invoked to get the optimal routing in the new geographical
    location for that Device.

    While the goal of the Traffic Influence API is to optimise the traffic in the mobile
    network to reach the local instance of the Edge Application Server, it is a task of the
    Application to generate the flow toward the expected Edge Application Server Instance.
    # Introduction
    The Traffic Influence API provides the capability to establish the optimal routing, in
    terms of latency, in a specific geographical area, between the user Device,
    e.g. the user’s smartphone, and the optimal Edge Application Server instance nearby. If the
    Device moves in a different geographical location where a more suitable Edge Application Server
    instance is available, the Traffic Influence API can be invoked again to influence the
    Device connectivity to get the optimal routing also in the new location.
    It is important to notice that the  service data flow is not automatically
    optimised when the user moves in a specific area, it is a task of the Traffic Influence API
    Consumer to detect the changes in the Device location and to invoke the
    Traffic Influence API consequently.

    The generic architecture for the Service can foresee some Cloud instances of
    the Application, one or more Edge Instances of the Application. The Traffic Influence API
    Consumer invokes the Traffic Influence API creating a "TrafficInfluence" resource
    specifying the desired intent.

    The Traffic Influence API Producer implements the intent specified in the
    "TrafficInfluence" resource.

    While the Traffic Influence API can be invoked to activate the optimal routing for any
    user, it can also be used to request the optimal routing for a specific user
    also specifying, as an option, a source public port and a destination public
    port and protocol. Invoking the Traffic Influence API for each user, many
    "TrafficInfluence" resources are created for each user to provide the
    requested routing for a set of users. If the Traffic Influence API is invoked to provide
    the optimal routing for any user and later it is required to provide the
    optimal access only for selected users, the previous intent/resource must
    be deleted.

    The same approach is used for the geographical areas where the influence
    of the traffic must be applied. Invoking the Traffic Influence API without specifying a
    geographical area, activates the optimal routing toward the closest Edge Application Server
    instance in any geographical location. This intent must be deleted if it is
    required to provide the optimal access only in selected areas. Invoking the
    Traffic Influence API specifying a geographical area activates the optimal routing only if
    the user is in that geographical area. The flow is optimised to reach the
    Edge Application Server instance located closest to that geographical area. In a different
    geographical area the user will not have the traffic flow optimised.

    To activate the optimal routing in selected geographical areas, the Traffic Influence API
    must be invoked for each geographical area. Anyway it is important to
    understand that the traffic optimisation strongly depends on the user's
    geographical location so it is important for the Traffic Influence API Consumer to always
    verify the position of the user invoking the Traffic Influence API for that user if it
    moves changing its location.
    The API API can also be used to optimise a specific traffic flow identified
    by a source port and a destination port and protocol. To optimise the flow
    from more source ports or destination ports or protocols, the Traffic Influence API must be
    invoked many times.

    It is important to notice that it is a task of the Client Application to
    use the most adequate means to send the application flow to the right
    server (Edge Application Server), for example using Edge DNS or using the target Edge Application Server IP address.
    The Traffic Influence API provides back the selected Edge Application Server instance identifier from which the
    Client Application can retrieve the destination IP address of its backed
    server, to properly configure the service data flow.

    The Traffic Influence API can be used to:
    - optimise the routing when Devices need to consume the service provided
      by a local Edge Application Server Instances.
    - affect an already established Device routing when the Device moves
      among different geographical locations. When the Traffic Influence API consumer detects
      a Device has entered a geographical location where an Edge Application Server instance is
      available, it can invoke the Traffic Influence API to get the optimal routing toward
      that Edge Application Server instance.
      If the Device moves to another geographical location, served by another
      Edge Application Server instance, the routing might not be optimal any more. In the case the
      Application detects a location change, it can invoke the Traffic Influence API again to
      request a new routing optimization toward the new Edge Application Server instance.
    ## Quick Start
    The Traffic Influence API is consumed by an Application Function (AF) requesting for the
    optimal routing, in term of latency, for the traffic flow from a Device
    toward Edge Application Server instances in Edge Cloud Zones.

    When the Application (the Edge Application Server) is onboarded and deployed in the Edge Cloud
    Zones, the Application is identified with a unique identifier ("appId").

    Using the application identifier ("appId") and specifying a Zone or a Region
    the Telco Operator Platform, autonomously identifies the best instance of
    the Edge Application Server toward which routing the traffic flow and configures the Mobile
    Network accordingly to get the fastest routing.

    If just the application identifier is used, the Telco Operator Platform
    identifies all the Edge Application Server Instances and activates the optimal routing on the
    Mobile Network.

    If the optimal routing in term of latency should be available just for a set
    of users, the Traffic Influence API must be invoked for each user creating a new
    TrafficInfluce resource for each one.
    If the Application offers different services on different interfaces a
    traffic filter based on IP, Port and Protocol can be used. I this way it is
    also possible to redirect different users to different interfaces.
    Here are some possible intents:
    1) activate the optimal routing for the closest Edge Application Server instance: the Traffic Influence API
    must be invoked with the "appId". The Telco Operator Platform identifies
    all the Edge Application Server instances and activates the optimal routing on the Mobile
    Network so that the user is connect to the closest Edge Application Server instance.
    2) activate the optimal routing in a specific Region or Zone: the Traffic Influence API
    must be invoked with the "appId" and the Zones and Regions identifiers.
    3) activate the optimal routing for a user Device: the Traffic Influence API can  be
    invoked with a user Device identifier (“Device”). For each user Device,
    a Traffic Influence API invocation is required. The optimal routing is provided only for
    the requested Devices.
    # API Documentation
    The usage of the Traffic Influence API is based on the management of a "TrafficInfluence"
    resource, an object containing the intent requested invoking the Traffic Influence API and
    that is implemented by the platform configuring the Mobile Network for the
    optimal routing toward the Edge Application Server instance.

    The "TrafficInfluence" resource can be created (providing the related
    parameters that specify the desired intent), queried, modified and
    deleted.

    The Traffic Influence API is asynchronous, a notification is available providing
    information about the status of the requested resource.
    For an Application (identified by "appId") many "TrafficInfluence" resources
    can be created, e.g. to add multiple users, regions or zones.

    When an intent is expressed and a resource have been created, if the intent
    must be modified, it is suggested to use the PATCH method
    (/traffic-influeces/{trafficInfluenceID}). Anyway, any other new intent
    (e.g. for the same device) will override the previous ones.

    Before starting to use the Traffic Influence API, the developer needs to know about the
    below specified details:

    **TrafficInfluence:**
    This object represents the resource that carries the requirements from the
    user to be implemented. The Traffic Influence API is invoked for the life cycle management
    of this resource (CRUD). The resource contains the intents from the Traffic Influence API
    Consumer. Managing this resource, the developer can specify in which
    geographical location the routing must be applied, toward which application,
    maybe for a specific set of users or for a limited period of time.

    **trafficInfluenceID:**
    Identifier for the Traffic Influence resource. This parameter is returned
    by the Traffic Influence API and must be used to update it (e.g., adding a Device or
    deleting it). A different Traffic Influence resource must be created for
    any Device or Zone or Region. All these resources are related to an
    Application identified by "appId".

    **apiConsumerId:**
    Unique identifier for the Traffic Influence API Consumer.

    **edgeCloudRegion:**
    The Developer can specify in which geographical area he requires the optimal
    routing toward application instances running there. An Edge Cloud Region is
    equivalent to a Region on a Public Cloud. The higher construct in the
    hierarchy exposed to an Application Provider who wishes to deploy an
    Application on the Edge Cloud and broadly represents a geography.
    An Edge Cloud Region typically contains one or multiple Edge Cloud Zones.
    The Edge Cloud Region name is provided by the Telco Operator and can also be
    used or retrieved with other CAMARA APIs (e.g. “Edge Application Management
    API”). To add more regions the Traffic Influence API must be invoked (POST) for each
    "region". If in a "region" there are many Application instances active in
    different "zones", the Traffic Influence API can be invoked to configure the optimal
    routing for all the instances with just one API call specifying the
    "region".

    If just the Application instances in some Edge Cloud Zone must be affected,
    the Traffic Influence API can be invoked for the zones of interest, without specifying
    the "region" in the API call. If just some specific Application instance
    must be affected, it is not required to specify any "region" or "zone",
    and the parameter "appInstanceId" can be used.

    **edgeCloudZoneId:**
    An Edge Cloud Zone is the lowest level of abstraction exposed to an
    Application Provider who wants to deploy an Application on Edge Cloud.
    Edge Cloud Zones exists within a Edge Cloud Region.

    To add more "zones" the Traffic Influence API must be invoked (POST) for each "zone".

    **appId:**
    A globally unique identifier associated with the application. This
    identifier is provided during the application onboarding process.
    To influence the traffic toward a specific Application. It is the Operator
    Platform that detects the appropriate Application instance in the selected
    "region" or "zone".

    **appInstanceId:**
    A globally unique identifier generated by the Operator Platform to identify
    a specific instance of the Application in a specific zone. To influence a
    traffic toward a specific Application instance. If just some specific
    Application instance must be affected, it is not required to specify any
    "region" or "zone", the parameter "appInstanceId" can be used.
    The value for appInstanceId can be retrieved using the CAMARA API
    Edge Application Management, included in the Edge Cloud API Family.

    **sourceTrafficFilters:**
    The traffic can be from a specific public port in the device. If this
    parameter is used, the influenced flow is from the public port defined in
    "sourceTrafficFilters" rather than the public port specified in "Device"

    **destinationTrafficFilters:**
    The Application can expose different service on different interfaces,
    identified by port and protocol, with this parameter it is possible to
    route the traffic toward a specific port and protocol exposed by the
    Application.

    **Device:**
    An user Device can be provided as an input. The Device can be identified by
    the phone number (phoneNumber) or by its IP Address (Ipv4Address,
    Ipv6Address) also specifying a Port. For IP address both the private (as
    seen from inside the Device) and the public (as seen over Internet by a
    server connected to the Device) can be used. To add more users the Traffic Influence API
    must be invoked (POST) of each user Device. New "TrafficInfluence"
    resources are created (with different "trafficInfluenceID"). The routing
    toward the selected Application instance is only applied for provided user
    Devices. "publicPort" can be used to identify the device. "publicPort" can
    be also used to identify the flow to be influenced. If the flow to be
    influenced is from a different public port, "sourceTrafficFilters" can be
    used. If more than one Device identifier is provided only one will be used
    by the Traffic Influence API to perform the network optimization. The one used is
    returned in the notification callback.

    **Notification:**
    Developers can specify a callback URL on which notifications
    regarding the requested intent can be received. The notification will be
    sent as a CloudEvent compliant message. For example to be notified when the
    requested optimal routing is active. It is also provided back the
    identifier for the selected Edge Application Server instance ("selected_appInstanceId")
    from which the Client Application can retrieve the destination IP address of
    its back-end server, to properly configure the service data flow. This
    information can be retrieved using the APIs, for example the Edge Application Management under development in CAMARA.
    # Authorization and authentication
    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how
    an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and
    Consent Management
    (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during
    the onboarding process, happening between the provider of the application
    consuming the API and the operator's API exposure platform, taking into
    account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being
    subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can
    exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out,
    the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that
    the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the
    principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.
    # Identifying the phone number from the access token
    This API optionally requires the API consumer to identify a phone number
    as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject
    will be identified from the optional `device` object field, which
    therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional
    identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely
    identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a
    three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the
    information that is associated with the access token and was
    identified during the authentication process.
    ## Error handling:
    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the
    optional `device` object field is not included in the request, then
    the server will return an error with the
    `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.
    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the
    optional `device` object field is also included in the request, then
    the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER`
    error code. This will be the case even if the same device is
    identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make
    this comparison.
    # Additional CAMARA error responses
    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive.
    Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error
    statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release
    associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses.
    The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the
    `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible
    error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

        future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use.
        After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not

          publicAddress and privateAddress.

          and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field
          ipv6Address of the Device object)
        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one

          identifiers is allowed in the response.
        If the API consumer provides more than one device identifier in their

        one they are using to fulfil the request, even if the identifiers do not
        match the same device. API provider does not perform any logic to
        validate/correlate that the indicated device identifiers match the same
        device. No error should be returned if the identifiers are otherwise
